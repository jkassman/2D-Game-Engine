Thoughts to do: make split not initiated from crack
when a crack detects that it needs to increase, have it store data
and indicate to shape that it should split.

add destructors
add consts


Overall structure:
Shape is defined by a bunch of lines; it has a vector of pointers to lines.
    -This is because lines get moved around from shape to shape when spliting.

Each line has a vector of many pointers to crack.

On a click, the Shape first discovers which (if any) line was clicked.
   -This function is fractureAt
It then should inform the line(s) that it was clicked.
   FUTURE TODO: multiple lines, + don't default to making a new crack.
The line then calls crack's increase() function. (or makes a new crack)

if increase() returns nonzero, that indicates that the crack has spread
across the entire shape. Therefore, the line's function should also return
nonzero.

This signals the shape that it has to split.
The shape then calls its split function.
It somehow has to put the new shape in the drawing queue.
